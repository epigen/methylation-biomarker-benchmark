# Quantitative comparison of locus-specific DNA methylation assays for large-scale validation studies and epigenetic biomarker development

Supplementary code repository accompanying the BLUEPRINT benchmark study of locus-specific DNA methylation assays.

## Repository structure:

There are only two directories:

+ ``/data``: tab-delimited text files containing all relevant assay data and metadata
+ ``/analysis``: a collection of R scripts, organized per figure of the article. ``methBench_analysis.R`` is an entry script that loads all required libraries and consecutively executes each step of the analysis
